This project contains my efforts to develop MIX processor emulator along eith assembler
and IDE to program it.

Project is OS X oriented.

Inaompatibility:

Bytes 0 and 1 in memory words are interpreted separately. So commands like LDA MEMORY (1:1)
are valid, unlike version in the book.


Knuth doesn't mention Program Counter as separate hardware register. Bu to work properly
I introduced this register to the CPU model. When program counter exceeds size of memory (MIX_MEMORY_SIZE)
it resets to 0 and continue without any exceptions generated.

When index regster is loaded with value of memory cell higher three bytes are just ignored. In original version
content of index register in this case is undefined.
