This project contains my efforts to develop MIX processor emulator along eith assembler
and IDE to program it.

Project is OS X oriented.

Inaompatibility:

Bytes 0 and 1 in memory words are interpreted separately. So commands like LDA MEMORY (1:1)
are valid, unlike version in the book.

Knuth doesn't mention Program Counter as separate hardware register. Bu to work properly
I introduced this register to the CPU model. When program counter exceeds size of memory (MIX_MEMORY_SIZE)
it resets to 0 and continue without any exceptions generated.

When index register is loaded with value of memory cell higher three bytes are just ignored. In original version
content of index register in this case is undefined.

When in DIV command divider is equal to 0 registers A and X become zero and overflow flag is set.

Commands in CPU Core debugged and supported with unit-tests for now  (8*8 Matrix):

     0x00  0x01  0x02  0x03  0x04  0x05  0x06  0x07

0x00   .    ADD   SUB   MUL   DIV    .     .     .

0x10  LDA   LD1   LD2   LD3   LD4   LD5   LD6   LDX

0x20  LDAN  LD1N  LD2N  LD3N  LD4N  LD5N  LD6N  LDXN

0x30  STA   ST1   ST2   ST3   ST4   ST5   ST6   STX

0x40  STJ   STZ    .     .     .     .     .     .

0x50   .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

0x60   .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
