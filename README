This project contains my efforts to develop MIX processor emulator along with assembler
and IDE to program it.

Project is OS X oriented.

In—Åompatibility:

Bytes 0 and 1 in memory words are interpreted separately. So commands like
LDA MEMORY (1:1) are valid, unlike version in the book.

Knuth doesn't mention Program Counter as separate hardware register. Bu to work properly
I introduced this register to the CPU model. When program counter exceeds size of memory (MIX_MEMORY_SIZE)
it resets to 0 and continue without any exceptions generated.

When index register is loaded with value of memory cell higher three bytes are just ignored. In original version
content of index register in this case is undefined.

When in DIV command divider is equal to 0 registers A and X become zero and overflow flag is set.
